## About this book

I have had great teachers, who taught me a lot and I’ve read many books about this world… but I’ve never managed to find the book that will solve all the doubts or that would give me a solid base on which to grow in a language as fascinating and stigmatized as it is JavaScript.

That’s why, this book is written as I liked them to be the ones I like when I started to code in JavaScript.

This book that you have right now in front of your eyes, is the result of my personal effort, in order to create an easy and simple instrument that shows the reader the basis of a language as peculiar and extended as JavaScript.

My idea is to start from scratch and make a journey together from the deep gulfs of doubt, through the pseudocode to the wonderful world of *[Ajax Calls](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/AJAX)*, making many stops along the way, where we will learn everything you need to start your adventure as a developer *[Front-end](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front-end_y_back-end)* with solid JavaScript bases.

## What do I need to know before I start?

It is not necessary to have programming experience, but it is important to be clear about the context of how static web pages are made, since in Part III we will focus on the dynamic manipulation of the *[DOM](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model)* and the *[AJAX calls](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/AJAX)*.

I will not elaborate much about *[HTML](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML)* and *[CSS](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoja_de_estilos_en_cascada)*, So I hope you already have some knowledge acquired. Although your level of knowledge and experience is relatively low, we have tried to avoid this being a brake on your learning in JavaScript.

If you have experience in other programming languages, you play with advantage at first, but do not rely ...

If you have already worked with *[JQuery](https://jquery.com/)* We will talk about how to do everything you do with JavaScript in the last chapters.

## What will we learn?

- Pseudocode.
- To think like a programmer.
- Work fluently with functions.
- Mastering JavaScript bases (language structures).
- Ajax and it's requests.
- Dynamic DOM manipulation.


## What will not we learn?

JavaScript is an immense universe that is growing by leaps and bounds with expansions. Remember that the idea is to lay the foundations of language, so we will not see things like:


Data Bases

: Either *[SQL](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_de_datos_relacional)* or *[NoSQL](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoSQL)*, is something that we do not intend to deal with in this book.


Paradigms  *[POO](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programaci%C3%B3n_orientada_a_objetos)*, *[Funcional](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programaci%C3%B3n_funcional)*, etc...)

: We will talk about some interesting concepts of the various paradigms that JavaScript offers, but we will not go further.


HTML5 APIs

: Although we will speak a little bit about things as powerful as *[LocalStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/es/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage)*, is very far from the bases of JavaScript on which we want to focus.


Regex (*[Regular Expressions](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expresi%C3%B3n_regular)*)

: It is very useful in day to day, and will be mentioned, but only above to understand how to deal with it as novice developers.


Design patterns (*[Decorator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decorator_pattern)*, *[Façade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facade_pattern)*...)

: They are many *[the patterns](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patr%C3%B3n_de_dise%C3%B1o)* Which we can apply to JavaScript for our code to acquire "super powers", but this is also very far from our goals.


Testing

: One of the pillars of good code is to do testing or follow philosophies like * TDD * or * TBD *. But for someone who starts in this world, I think it would be a brake on your learning.


*[Git](https://git-scm.com/)* and *[Github](https://github.com/)*

: Another of the things without which one can not be considered a real developer, if he does not know how to be fluent in it.


Frameworks  *[Angular](https://angularjs.org/)*, *[React](https://facebook.github.io/react/)*, *[Polymer](https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/)*, *[Backbone](http://backbonejs.org/)*, etc...)

: *[The fever MV* of JavaScript](https://gist.github.com/g6scheme/4157554)* Will remain out of this book for obvious reasons ... but remember that here we will use the most popular and verteran JavaScript *[framework](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Framework)*, *[Vanilla-js](http://vanilla-js.com/)*.


Bookstores  *[Jquery](https://jquery.com/)*, *[Mathjs](http://mathjs.org/)*, *[Momments.js](http://momentjs.com/)*...)

: The idea of this book is to work on JavaScript-old school-life, in the style of *[Douglas Crockford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Crockford)*. That's why we will not work with *[JQuery](https://jquery.com/)* directly, or with any other bookstore, although we will recommend many other libraries.


ECMAScript 6, ECMAScript 7

: Although we will talk about certain things that it has brought with him *[ECMAScript 6](http://es6-features.org/#Constants)*, however we will focus on the classic *[ECMAScript 5.1](https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/)* (valid since 2011) with one enviable  *[native compatibility](http://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es5/)*.


Node.js

: I love *[Node.js](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node.js)*, for having the full potential of JavaScript, without browser restrictions ... dive into a * [asynchronous world](https://www.todojs.com/controlar-la-ejecucion-asincrona/)* fnfinite possibilities where you can create from *[servers Http](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Servidor_web)*, to amaizing things as [robots](https://github.com/OSWeekends/OSWaldito/)*...

: *[Node.js](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node.js)* gives for a collection of books by itself, and for that reason it is very far from our objectives.


*[Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/)*, *[Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/)*, *[Broccoli](http://broccolijs.com/)*...

: Although automation and task management is another of the things that fascinate me, also it falls far short of the goals we have set. I am sorry!...

Also, I would like to demystify some things:

Maths

: Program is to make magic with machines, mathematics is optional ...

Advanced Mathematics, Statistics, etc ...

: To master the knowledge and techniques of JavaScript, you only need to know how to add, subtract, divide and multiply ... that's it!

Nuclear physics

: A little humor.


*[Artificial Intelligence](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inteligencia_artificial)*

: This is still a little far, but keep working... ¡Padawan!


## Important

Humor

: If you do not laugh at some point while reading this book .... clearly is not for you and I have not met the challenge of trying to teach you amazing things with a little humor :-D


Zero cost, $ 0

: This book is completely free, with a double objective, that no one is left without learning for not having resources and also to contribute in this way to the community of * [free software] (https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki /Free software)*.

: Although the book is free, * [Leanpub] (https://leanpub.com/) * it allows you to buy this book at a price you consider. All benefits generated will be donated to * [Code Club] (https://www.codeclub.org.uk/) * from the [Leanpub] platform itself (https://leanpub.com/) *. The author will not receive any of these donations.


Adaptable

: In principle this book is available in three basic formats * pdf *, * mobi *, * epub * and its source code is in * [Markua] (http://markua.com/) *. But starting from the [repository in GitHub] () can be converted to more formats.


This book is alive

: Over time it will grow and improve. Stay up to date on your * [official page] (https://leanpub.com/javascript-inspirate/) *


A sea of resources

: Most of the links in the book, direct you to technical blogs and the official documentation of * [Mozilla Developer Network] (https://developer.mozilla.org/es/) *. If a concept is difficult to understand or you want to go deeper ... these links can be a good starting point.


Features

: Most of the code is created with the nomenclature in Spanish, to facilitate the understanding and reading by new developers. However, remember that this is not considered a good practice in professional settings.


At your own pace!

: Throughout the book you will notice that there are numerous explanatory examples. However you will not find exercises, to make your reading more agile and to encourage you to come to one of the many meetings of the community (* [JS Dojo] (https://www.meetup.com/en-US/ JS-Dojo-Madrid /) *, * [Open Source Weekends] (https://www.meetup.com/en-US/Open-Source-Weekends/) * ...) and practice with real projects and with some time you come to propose your own projects within the community.
